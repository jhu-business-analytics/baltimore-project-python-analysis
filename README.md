# Baltimore City Government Project Data Analysis
This repository contains a template Jupyter Lab notebook for data analysis with pandas and data visualization creation with Plotly Express. You should work with your team to determine what kinds of visualizations might be helpful for you do develop data-driven business solutions for your team in Baltimore City Government. 

## Assignment
Each student must complete an individual assignment in a private repository under their own github username, and share this with Melanie (@melanieshimano). You should work with your team members to clean your data and to decide on the useful data visualizations for your midpoint meetings, however, each team member should aim to create different visualizations in their individual repositories. This analysis should inform your midpoint meetings with Balitmore City government, questions for Baltimore City contacts, and additional analysis to develop your eventual "business answer" and strategy.
